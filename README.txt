Playing

wasd moves, arrow keys aim, space shoots
xbox controllers allow two players to play

shoot other player to get points
if you get shot you lose health
the damage done depends on the color of the shot and the active color of the person who gets shot
if you die you wait to respawn
the fluid pool heals you if you stand in it
vibration is really cool
